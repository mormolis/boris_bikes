# Week 1 Challenge - Makers Academy

## Brief Description
To help structure your work, here are 22 challenges. They all build on one another. They require you to research things, to get stuck, and to find your own solutions. This is on purpose. A developer is a 'knowledge worker' - someone who will spend the majority of their time researching and learning how to solve problems. It'll suck for a bit, but with practice, you will get faster: and there's no better feeling than finding the answer to a problem that's been standing in your way for hours.


## Challenge 1
Setting up the project (Git repo)

To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [x] Create a directory from the command line
- [x] Initialize a git repository within that directory
- [x] Create a README.md file from the command line
- [ ] Write a clear README
- [x] Add the README.md to the staging area
- [x] Commit your changes with a clear message
- [x] Push the project to Github.

## Challenge 2
Converting user's stories to Object-messages tables


## Challenge 3

To complete this challenge, you will need to:
 - [x] Start irb (or any other REPL) from the Command Line
 - [x] Set a variable docking_station equal to a new DockingStation object
